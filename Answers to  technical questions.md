## How long did you spend on the coding test? 
I began the coding test on the designated day, Tuesday, July 16th. With my knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Material-UI, I decided to pursue this technology stack. On day one, I spent about four hours planning the user interface and functionality. Day two included three hours of working on the functionality, however I ran across some TypeScript issues. On the third day, I revised the design and concentrated on getting the functionality correct before tackling the UI. Finally, on the fourth day, I added filters and search features to ensure that the application fit the specifications.

## What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it. 
I'm not sure about the most useful feature, but TypeScript's satisfies operator would certainly be one of them. It allows me to assert that an expression adheres to a specific type without changing its type inference. This feature enhances type safety by ensuring that objects and variables conform to expected structures while keeping their original type information intact. In contrast to JavaScript, where type checking is less strict and often relies on runtime validation, TypeScript's satisfies operator provides compile-time assurance of type correctness.

## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this? 
As a fresher with limited experience, my approach to tracking down performance issues in production would be to start by reviewing metrics and logs to identify where the performance degradation is occurring. I would look for spikes in response times, error rates, or resource usage. Client feedback can also provide valuable insights into performance problems. Additionally, I would check if the database is performing well and consider implementing caching solutions like Redis to improve performance based on the findings.

## If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application? 
If I had more time, I would enhance the task management application by focusing on code reusability and cleanliness through the creation of more modular components. Implementing data validation with libraries like Yup or Zod would ensure data integrity. Additionally, I would incorporate authentication middleware to enhance security and further improve the integration of React DND for a smoother drag-and-drop experience.
